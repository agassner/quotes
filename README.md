The idea of this project is to be a stock screener written in Scala.

There are two modules initially:
 - The Python module downloads shares prices from Yahoo! Finance (Existing module - to be migrated to Scala)
 - Scala module does the rest :)

Initial ideas:
 - Day trading only
 - Being able to add criteria
